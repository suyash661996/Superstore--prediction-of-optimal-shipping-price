# Superstore--prediction-of-optimal-shipping-price
The main objective of this Project is to build the best predictive model for a Supply Chain and Logistics firm by comparison between various models based on their goodness of fit parameter estimation. The proposed analysis will be done on Python, MS Excel and Minitab. The main objective would be finding out the optimal predictors from the dataset by performing sufficient data clean-up and data transformation in order to suit the analysis. 
The following is the proposed course of action:
1.	Data pre-processing in Python which will include data clean-up and transformation. 
2.	Exploratory data analysis using the stats models and matplotlib libraries of Python.
3.	Computing the descriptive statistics of the various variables associated with the dataset.
4.	Identifying the relevant predictors from the dataset.
5.	Building predictive models using the scikit learn library of Python.
6.	Computing the goodness of fit parameters of the predictive model and comparison between models.
7.	Generating forecasts based on the optimal model.
